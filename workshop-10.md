# What is Ingress?

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

```sh
        internet
            |
      [ Ingress ]
      --|-----|--
      [ Services ]
```

You must have an ingress controller to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

You may need to deploy an ingress controller such as ingress-nginx. There are a number of ingress controllers you may choose from.

## Exercise: Set up Ingress on Minikube with the NGINX Ingress Controller
**Objective** Install the nginx ingress controller in minikube via addon.

---

1. To enable the NGINX Ingress controller, run the following command:

    ```sh
    $ minikube addons enable ingress
    ```

2. Verify that the NGINX Ingress controller is `Running`

    ```sh
    $ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -w | grep ingress
    ```

    **Note**: This can take up to a minute.

## Exercise: Create fanout ingress-controlled app
**Objective** To be able to create a fanout ingress access that redirects traffic between v1 and v2 of an example app.

### Deploy app (v1)

1. Create a Deployment using the following command:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl run web --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0 --port=8080
    ```

2. Expose the Deployment:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl expose deployment web --target-port=8080 --type=NodePort
    ```
3. Verify the Service is created and is available on a node port:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl get service web
    ```

4. Visit the service via `NodePort`

    ```sh
    $ minikube service web --url
    ```

#### Create an Ingress resource

LetÂ´s send traffic to your Service via hello-world.info.

1. Create the ingress

    **Command**

    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f workshop-10/manifests/example-ingress.yaml
    ```
2. Verify the IP address is set

    **Command**

    ```sh
    $ kubectl get ingress
    ```

3. Add the following line to the bottom of the /etc/hosts file.

    ```sh
    $ echo "$(minikube ip) hello-world.info" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

4. Test the ingress

    ```sh
    $ curl hello-world.info
    ```

### Deploy app (v2)

1. Create a v2 Deployment using the following command:
  
    ```sh
    $ kubectl run web2 --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0 --port=8080
    ```

2. Expose the Deployment:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl expose deployment web2 --target-port=8080 --type=NodePort
     ```

### Update Ingress

1. Edit the existing `workshop-10/manifests/example-ingress.yaml` and add the following lines:

    ```yaml
    - path: /v2/*
       backend:
         serviceName: web2
         servicePort: 8080
    ```

2. Apply the changes:

      ```sh
      $ kubectl apply -f workshop-10/manifests/example-ingress.yaml
      ```

3. Test the accesses:

    ```sh
    $ curl hello-world.info
    ```

    ```sh
    $ curl hello-world.info/v2
    ```

## Clean up

  ```sh
  $ kubectl delete all -lrun=web
  $ kubectl delete all -lrun=web2
  $ kubectl delete ingress fanout-ingress
  ```
